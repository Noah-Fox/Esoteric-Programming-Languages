l?!ae0@@3[08. > n;

  Returns the tenth value of the fibonacci sequence, unless the stack has a preset value 

  Solves the fibonacci sequence recursively (and is very slow)

  First line is the initialization. Below is the function

>:?!v1-:?!v    :1[fd+8@@08. > $1-1[13f*+8@@08. > +@].
          >~1v
    >~0      > @].
